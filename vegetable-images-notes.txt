VEGETABLE IMAGES RECOMMENDATIONS

To complete the update to realistic vegetable images, please add the following images to your "images" folder:

1. tomato.png
   - A realistic but slightly hand-drawn style tomato
   - Should include the green stem on top
   - Recommended size: approximately 100x100px with transparent background
   - Should have vibrant red color for day mode compatibility

2. pepper.png
   - A green bell pepper in hand-drawn style 
   - Ideally at a slight angle to match the previous design's rotation
   - Recommended size: approximately 100x100px with transparent background

3. cucumber.png
   - A green cucumber in hand-drawn style
   - Should be slightly elongated (horizontal orientation)
   - Recommended size: approximately 100x80px with transparent background

4. carrot.png
   - An orange carrot with green leaves at the top
   - Should be slightly taller than wide (vertical orientation)
   - Recommended size: approximately 60x120px with transparent background

5. broccoli.png
   - A green broccoli floret with a short brown stem
   - Recommended size: approximately 90x100px with transparent background

Image Sources Options:
1. Create your own hand-drawn style vegetable images
2. Use stock images with transparent backgrounds (make sure you have proper licensing)
3. Find free vector images with appropriate licensing
4. Use AI image generators to create custom vegetable images

Style Guidelines:
- All vegetables should have a consistent hand-drawn style
- Use transparent backgrounds (PNG format)
- Images should look cohesive as a set
- Avoid overly realistic or photographic styles - a slightly stylized, illustrative approach works best
- Colors should be vibrant for day mode, as night mode will automatically darken them

Night Mode Considerations:
- The CSS already applies a darker filter to images in night mode
- No separate night mode images are needed

Implementation Notes:
- The CSS has been updated to handle these images correctly
- Images will automatically have drop shadows applied
- The hover and click effects will still work with the new images
- Responsive sizing has been maintained

After adding these images to the "images" folder, the website should display the new, more realistic vegetables immediately.
